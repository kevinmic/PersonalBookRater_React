      review: "My name is Rylynn Sinclair, and I have survived the Admiral’s Challenge and my first month at the Legion Fleet Academy. I was even made a crewman, along with my friends, stationed on the Hail Mary.  Then my past caught up with me.  It all started with Ace showing up in my room talking with my roommate, and the letter he had. From that point on, everything in my life started to pull me back to Colony Lenti and the secrets that surrounded it."
